# wikiConnect

This idea was sparked by a game I used to play - the objective was to get form one wikipedia article to another using only the links inside articles. I started wondering if it is actually possible to get from every article to any other using this method. Honestly I am not sure if it is at all possible to achieve but if you have any ideas on how to optimize the existing code go ahead and make commits. The project utilizes BeautifulSoup so you will have to have it installed to run the program

Just as a disclaimer I want to say that this project is not serious in any way but just a bit of programming fun.
